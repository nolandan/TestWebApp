    <h1><strong>Hello World! </strong><small>A test in styling using Bootstrap</small></h1>

    <p>Here, we can play with a few different styling ideas, generally provided by Bootstrap. Using less
        allows us to fiddle with some custom themes without necessarily having too much Bootstrap classage in the
        HTML code itself. What we can do at this point is to give a basic introduction into the world of styling, designing
        and Bootstrapping. Although I've not fiddled with Bootstrap before, it does seem pretty easy to do.</p>
